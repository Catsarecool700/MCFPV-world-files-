# MCFPV-world-files-
just making this encase i die or something and yall need the world files to create your own server

[the city map probs wont get much updating](https://mega.nz/file/B7xlAS5Y#nIvHm9NpkMuY8clUXupo0KZWV3Eoy29qH2teSC3lO00)
[but the survival should be updated every month or so](https://mega.nz/file/EuYjEAoC#r09wHleN0FJcYU4OciBIQkR3oAo6f5C2TXxKszuhgb8)

World just aint getting uploaded here since its like 60gigs and I dont wanna deal with that 

  (the hyperlinks lead to mega downloads for the worlds since github doesnt like how big the files are)
